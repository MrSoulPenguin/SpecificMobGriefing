## Specific Mob Griefing

Simple serverside mod that adds in more specific gamerules to better control certain aspects of "mob griefing".

Gets a lil' annoying wanting to make a Villager breeder, but would also prefer Endermen not spatter
the land with their mess. So we've got this.

Following are the gamerules added. They do what they say on the tin:
* allowVillagerItemPickup
* allowPiglinBartering
* allowEndermanBlockInteraction
* allowCreeperExplosionDestruction
* allowGhastExplosionDestruction
